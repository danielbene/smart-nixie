This is my very first PCB design that I have ever made, so detailed opinions for better execution is welcome. I used EasyEDA designer, and ordered the first batch from JLCPCB.

You can find the gerber files here. These are used for production, and it's compatible with most manufacturer's order processing. (For modifyability a project backup file is inluded too.)
