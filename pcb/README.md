# PCB
Version: 1.0  

This is the first PCB design that I have ever made, so detailed opinions for better execution is welcome. I used EasyEDA designer, and ordered the first batch from JLCPCB.

You can find the gerber files here. These are used for production, and it's compatible with most manufacturer's order processing. (For modifyability a project backup file is included too.)

### Notes
 - Version 1.0 was fully functional after assembly. It was easy to solder and a decent design. The pcb footprint was bigger than I imagined based on the project files (don't get me wrong I had the correct dimensions, but it just looks bigger). I see some minor design flaws that I would like to correct in later versions, but I'm quite satisfied and proud of it.

The arrived pcbs were really high quality, so I'm totally satisfied with the service of JLCPCB. (Got a branded keychain as a bonus too.)
