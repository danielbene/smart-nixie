BEWARE TRAVELLER! This thing is so unnecessarily overengeneered that it can make a crocodile cry (theoretically). You tought a simple four digit clock wouldn't need wifi connection, or a count up timer, or maybe a humidity sensor?! YOU WERE WRONG! I added many things to this badboy, because... well... I COULD!

So, let me just put that marketing aside. This is my wifi-enabled nixie clock that I proudly present to you. I'm a beginner with electronics, but a bit better around code, so don't you dare judge me on my technical decisions. I wanted to make the most out of my design, only because of the sake of my own fulfillment.

Main aspects of the project:
	- working four digit nixie clock display (as you probably guessed)
	-
